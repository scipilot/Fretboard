#Drop 3 is good for solo accompaniment without a bass player.
#Drop 2 & 4 chords are great strumming chords
#Drop 2 & 3 are good for finger style
#Partial chords are three note chords that are good for quick tempos or more compact sounds. Partial Chords are so names as they leave out a note from a four note voicing such as a Drop 2.
